## Reason
This project was made for University purpose and to become experienced with HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Its content is about exercises with which students of high school in Greece
can test their knowledge in subject computer science. There are not a lot of wesbites that serve this purpose and have a userfriendly environment.

## About the code
The following files of code produce a website, which consists of five tabs (main page, quiz1, quiz2, quiz3, about us). All of them are connected together and no instructions 
is necessary to be given. Just download all the code files and the folder which contains the .mp3 and the images(make sure to fix the paths in the .html files and index.css). 
Then use a program to open them in order to see the code and find an extension to convert these files into a website. In our case we used **Visual Studio Code** with the extension **Live Server**. 

## The result
The whole project has been made with the support of Aimilios Pavlidis(https://github.com/AimiliosPavlidis2001) who is shown in tab "About us".<br>
